# ember-service-worker-enqueue
An Ember Service Worker plugin that catches failed mutation requests e.g POST, PUT, DELETE and queues them for background processing.

It uses Mozillaâ€™s localforage db wrapper to enqueue mutation requests that failed either because of a failed network e.g Flacky networks or Offline mode, or server errors to perform the operations once the connection is regained and/or periodically until it succeeds.

Currently, many configuration options are hard-coded e.g expected location of localforage.min.js but I'll update it soon.

Enjoy!
